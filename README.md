# Machine_Learning
## This repo contains introduction to some of the most important machine learning and data-analysis techniques.
### Filenames are preceded by DDMMYY. For descriptions and more check the Wiki Page.  

*PCA_Muller.py 190818:* Principal component analysis example with breast cancer data-set. 

*270918: RidgeandLin.py, LassoandLin.py:* Lasso and Ridge regression examples.     

*081018: bank.csv*, data set of selling products of a portuguese company to random customers over phone call(s). Data-set description is available [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing).

*161018: gender_purchase.csv*, data-set of two columns describing customers buying a product depending on gender.

*111118: winequality-red.csv*, red wine data set, where the output is the quality column which ranges from 0 to 10.

*121118: pipelineWine.py*, A simple example of applying pipeline and gridsearchCV together using the red wine data.  

*24112018: lagmult.py*, This program just demonstrate a simple constrained optimization problem using figures.   

*11122018: Consumer_Complaints_short.csv*, 3 columns describing the complaints, product_label and category. Complete file can be obtained from [Govt.data](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/consumer-complaint-database/resource/2f297213-7198-4be1-af1e-2d2623e7f6e9). 

*13122018: Text-classification_compain_suvo.py*, Classify the consumer complaints data, which is already described above. 

1912018: SVMdemo.py*, this program shows the effect of using RBF kernel to map from 2d space to 3d space. Animation requires ffmpeg in unix system. 

*05032019: IBM_Python_Web_Scrapping.ipynb*, Deals with basic web scrapping, string handling, image manipulation.

*06042019: datacleaning*, Folder containing files and images related to data cleaning with pandas.
